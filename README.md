# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project aims to develop an image-based plant disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify and identify diseases from images of plant leaves with high accuracy. The goal is to provide farmers and agricultural professionals with a reliable and scalable tool to detect plant diseases early.
